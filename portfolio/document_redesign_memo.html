This portion of the current document is confusing and difficult to understand, and the revisions I have made should make it much clearer, allowing the printer’s operator to quickly determine the solution to their problems with printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">The first step I take in modifying this document is to remove the separate columns of instructions for Windows and Macintosh systems. Although this may seem advantageous, the way the columns are separated makes some of the instructions that should apply to both systems seem to apply to only one system or the other, and integrates correctly some steps that are meant for just one operating system. Instead of using the two column method, I decided to enter the system-specific information in separate text boxes, allowing the user to tell at a glance which steps they needed to follow for their system. I also added a Windows and a Macintosh logo to each box, to provide a further visual cue to the user to tell at a glance which steps would apply to their system.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Also, while there is a good use of contrasting color in the original document, and even good graphics in many other sections of the overall document, I noticed several problems with the way this particular section looked. The main headers throughout the document are a nice bright blue to stand out, but the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">rest of the page is hard to decipher at a glance. I replaced most of the initial color to improve unity in  the document and also deleted the side tab informing the reader (unnecessarily) that they are reading the English directions. In the original document, there is bold text spread randomly throughout the document, which seems to make it hard to tell what to focus on. I am adding better signposts in the document, and I vary the size of the text more, with more consistent bolding. Each initial step now stands out, with the details about the steps in smaller text, available to read if necessary, but allowing the user to skip unimportant details if they choose. I also worked to line things up better on the page, so that the reader could quickly scan for the instructions they need. Originally, the acknowledgements and anonymous user information were in the same size and type of font as the instructions, making them appear to be equally important to troubleshooting the machine. I changed this information to end notes and footnotes so that it was available if the reader wanted to look at it, but it did not distract and interfere with the information they would need to correct network issues and troubleshoot printing problems.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">I chose this section of the document to revise because I believe the troubleshooting and networking pages are two of the most important sections of the user manual, most likely to be reviewed by operators even after the initial installation of the printer, and because of this importance to the user, should be given a better graphic presentation that will make them easier to follow. Time-pressured system administrators and family “technical support” members such as myself will appreciate the clarity and the ease of use these clarifications will provide. Overall, I believe the CRAP principles I applied helped with providing more consistent and readable contrast, repeating logos and font sizes and paragraph structures, aligning different parts of text correctly, as well as adding boxes to line things up better, and positioning the various bullet points and headers correctly to help define the most important parts of the document and how they fit together.</p></body></html>
